# KNN
#Love Thy neighbor: "Nearest Neighbor Classifierâ€”classification is achieved by identifying the nearest neighbors to a query example and using those neighbors to determine the class of the query."

# What is the best value for k?

# What distance measure is best for the data, e.g., Cosine, Euclidean, Correlation?

# Does it help to include distance weighting?
